# samp-texa-roleplay-game-mode
San Andreas Multiplayer roleplay server game mode. 

Hi, this is a samp roleplay game mod file. The mod is designed for Turkish language. The mod is quite dynamic and most things have been fixed. I hope you can set up the server you want thanks to this mod. I had a lot of fun with my friends while doing this project. Without them, none of this would have happened, we were very supportive of each other. They have been very supportive of me. I hope you and your team will succeed in a happy business.
