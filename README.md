Hi, this is a samp roleplay game mod file. The mod is designed for Turkish language. The mod is quite dynamic and most things have been fixed. I hope you can set up the server you want thanks to this mod. Good luck to everyone so far.

- Import the samp.sql file in the downloaded files to the database(samp).
- Update SQL information in game mode with the Pawno app.
